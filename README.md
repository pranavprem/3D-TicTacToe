# 3D-TicTacToe

# Objective
Idea is to present a proof of concept for a game - Three dimensional Tic Tac Toe (aka X-O)
The idea is to create a game that is easy to learn and play and lasts the entire length of a lecture at Goa College of Engineering :D

# Rules
Screen intially shows the master/outer tic tac toe. Clicking on a square will take you into the inner tic tac toe.
In order for a player to put their mark (X/O) on the master tic tac toe, they must first win inside the inner tic tac toe.
Players win by having the regular 3 in a row (vertical/horizontal/diagonal) of their marker in the master tic tac toe.
